						<p><b>What is VizPort One?</b><br>
						VizPort One is the first tool of the Visualization Portal for for Biological Data. It is an ongoing data visualization project that obtains protein variation data from the Ensembl API and organizes and visualizes it in a simple, yet very effective and easy to use way.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-8 question">
						<p><b>What proteins can be currently found on the platform?</b><br>
						There is a small amount of proteins that can be currently found on the platform. Historically relevant proteins such as BRCA-2 and ERBB-2 can be visualized, as well as non-cancer related proteins such as APP-001 and PPARG-003. The number of proteins will continue to increase with the development of this tool. If you would like to suggest a protein, please contact us.</p>
